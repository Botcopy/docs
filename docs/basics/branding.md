# Branding
Botcopy offers the most customizable chat client on the market today. The **Branding** page on your portal is the master page for the entire look and feel of your bot, and has a live preview so you can see your changes in real time. Every hexcode used in the chat window can be changed in the Branding page. This page also has a number of **pre-styled color themes** available.

## Images
The **Images** section allows you to adjust the images and greeter of your bot. You may upload your own image for the greeter and bot's avatar in the chat here, or choose from a selection of Botcopy's greeter and avatar images.

You may also change the shape of the greeter and the size of the image within the greeter image field.

## Colors
The colors section gives control over every color used in the chat window. Each may be customized to give you full control of the look of the bot's minimized state, messaging, header, components, and more.

The first panel, **Greeter and Prompts**, deals with the colors of the minimized greeter and prompt bubble experience.

The second panel, **Chat Window**, deals with the maximized chat experience and controls colors of the header, body, and input bar of the chat window.

The final panel, **Components**, controls the colors of Botcopy's components *todo: add hyperlink to components section here*.

## Settings
The settings section deals with Branding configurations not related to colors.

### Greeter Settings
Change the animation of the greeter when it first loads on a website.

### Prompts Settings
Choose to display the greeter and prompts or hide them entirely, and also choose to display suggestion chips under the prompt.

### Chat Window Settings
Select the size of the window, or if it should be rendered fullscreen with CUI Mode *todo: add hyperlink to CUI mode*. You may also change the Z-Index of the chat window here.

### Header Settings
Select from our Header types and choose what functionality is available on the header (Maximize, Clear Conversation, etc.)

### Body Settings
Adjust the font type of your bot, show the Bot's avatar image, and hide the "UI by {••}" tag.

### Input Bar Settings
Choose from Input Bar types and whether the microphone should be displayed.

## CUI Mode
CUI stands for **Conversational User Interface**. It is a full-screen chat experience that replaces a website or specific web page(s) within a site. The chat window remains the same, with the exception of removing the _minimize_ and _close_ buttons normally seen on the header. This behavior can be set for an entire bot, or for individual pages of your website by giving the page a Bot Prompt configured to CUI mode.
